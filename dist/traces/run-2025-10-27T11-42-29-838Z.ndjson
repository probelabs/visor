{"name":"visor.check","attributes":{"visor.check.id":"unknown","visor.check.output":"{\"text\":\"This pull request introduces a new user search feature. Based on test fixtures, it appears to add a new file, `src/search.ts`, containing a `search` function. The initial implementation returned an empty array, and this update modifies it to return the search query itself.\\n\\n### Files Changed Analysis\\n\\n-   **`src/search.ts`**: Modified (+1 addition, +0 deletions).\\n    -   This file seems to be the core of the change, introducing or updating the search functionality. Although the file was not found in the source tree, its content and modification are clearly documented in the test fixtures (`src/test-runner/fixture-loader.ts`).\\n\\n### Architecture & Impact Assessment\\n\\nThis PR accomplishes the initial implementation of a user search feature.\\n\\n**Key Technical Changes:**\\n\\n-   A new `search` function is introduced in `src/search.ts`.\\n-   The function's behavior is updated from returning a hardcoded empty array to returning the provided search query. This is likely a preliminary step for a more complex implementation.\\n\\n**Affected System Components:**\\n\\n-   **Search Module**: A new or updated module for handling search queries.\\n-   **Testing Framework**: The test runner's fixtures (`src/test-runner/fixture-loader.ts`) have been updated to reflect the changes in the search functionality, indicating an impact on the testing infrastructure.\\n\\nHere is a diagram illustrating the likely flow:\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\n    A[Client] --> B{API Endpoint};\\n    B --> C[Search Service];\\n    C --> D[search() in src/search.ts];\\n    D -- Returns search query --> C;\\n    C --> B;\\n    B --> A;\\n```\\n\\n### Scope Discovery & Context Expansion\\n\\nThe change is currently isolated to the `search` function. However, the introduction of this feature implies a broader scope:\\n\\n-   **API Layer**: An API endpoint will be needed to expose this search functionality to users.\\n-   **Data Source**: The `search` function will eventually need to interact with a data source (e.g., a database, an external API) to fetch actual user data.\\n-   **UI/Client**: A user interface component will be required for users to input search queries and view results.\\n\\nFurther investigation would involve looking for:\\n\\n-   The API route that calls this `search` function.\\n-   Configuration files related to user data sources.\\n-   Unit and integration tests for the search feature to understand its expected behavior and edge cases.\",\"tags\":{\"review-effort\":1,\"label\":\"feature\"}}"},"events":[]}
