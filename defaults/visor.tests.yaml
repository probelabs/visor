# Integration test suite for Visor default configuration
# - Driven by events + fixtures; no manual step lists
# - Strict by default: every executed step must have an expect
# - AI mocks accept structured JSON when a schema is defined; plain uses text
# - GitHub calls are recorded by default by the test runner (no network)

tests:
  defaults:
    strict: true
    ai_provider: mock
    fail_on_unexpected_calls: true
    # Run GitHub-tagged checks in tests (e.g., label application)

    # Example: enable negative GitHub recorder for all tests
    # github_recorder: { error_code: 429 }
  # Built-in fixtures are provided by the test runner (gh.* namespace).
  # Custom fixtures may still be added here if needed.
