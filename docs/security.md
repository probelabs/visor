## 🔐 Security Defaults

- Prefer GitHub App for bot identity and granular org/repo permissions.
- Lock remote extends with `--allowed-remote-patterns`; default is off.
- No external network calls unless configured (providers, HTTP checks, etc.).
- Document where tokens are used; rotate provider keys regularly.
