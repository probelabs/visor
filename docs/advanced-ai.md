## ðŸ§  Advanced AI Features

### AI Session Reuse
Use `reuse_ai_session: true` on dependent checks to continue conversation context with the AI across checks. This improves followâ€‘ups and consistency.

**Session Modes:**
- **`clone` (default)**: Creates a copy of the conversation history. Each check gets an independent session with the same starting context. Changes made by one check don't affect others.
- **`append`**: Shares the same conversation thread. All checks append to a single shared history, creating a true multi-turn conversation.

```yaml
steps:
  security:
    type: ai
    prompt: "Analyze code for security vulnerabilities..."

  security-remediation:
    type: ai
    prompt: "Based on our security analysis, provide remediation guidance."
    depends_on: [security]
    reuse_ai_session: true
    # session_mode: clone (default - independent copy of history)

  security-verify:
    type: ai
    prompt: "Verify the remediation suggestions are complete."
    depends_on: [security-remediation]
    reuse_ai_session: true
    session_mode: append  # Share history - sees full conversation
```

**When to use each mode:**
- Use **`clone`** (default) when you want parallel follow-ups that don't interfere with each other
- Use **`append`** when you want sequential conversation where each check builds on previous responses

### XML-Formatted Analysis
Visor uses structured XML formatting when sending data to AI providers, enabling precise and context-aware analysis for both pull requests and issues.

### Incremental Commit Analysis
When new commits are pushed to a PR, Visor performs incremental analysis:
- Full Analysis: Reviews the entire PR on initial creation
- Incremental Analysis: On new commits, focuses only on the latest changes
- Smart Updates: Updates existing review comments instead of creating duplicates

### Intelligent Comment Management
- Unique Comment IDs: Each PR gets a unique review comment that persists across updates
- Collision Detection: Prevents conflicts when multiple reviews run simultaneously
- Context-Aware Updates: Comments are updated with relevant context (PR opened, updated, synchronized)
